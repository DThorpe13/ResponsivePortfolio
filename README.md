# ResponsivePortfolio
This project is a basic, responsive portfolio primarily using bootstrap and grid systems. 

I used bootstrap and rows/columns to create a responsive navbar that is consistant on each page.

I also used bootstrap to create a jumbotron on my home page, where I also used rows and columns to give my self image and text a separate, more organized look.

Underneath my jumbotron on my home page, I once again used rows and columns to separate my cards. I used cards to emphasize each key task I have gained experience in while working in my field.

On each page, I also added in a footer where I stored my social media icons, which are also fully responsive links.

I also added in a reset.css sheet to keep my code organized throughout all browsers.

Each link and library that was used for this project was referenced in the head of my documents.
